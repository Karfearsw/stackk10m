Architecture Phase Responses

## 11. Reuse vs. Build from Scratch

**Recommended Approach: Hybrid - Iterative Enhancement of Flipstackk 3.0 Foundation**​

**Reuse Components from Flipstackk 3.0:**​

- **Technology Stack**: Continue with Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui (Modern, proven, team-familiar)​
    
- **Database & ORM**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM (Robust, type-safe, good migration support)​
    
- **Authentication Pattern**: NextAuth Credentials with RBAC (admin, acquisitions, caller, investor roles)​
    
- **Core Data Models**: Lead structure, buyer profiles, status pipeline concepts can evolve vs. rebuild from zero
    
- **UI Component Library**: shadcn/ui provides consistent, accessible components avoiding reinventing basics​
    

**Build New for Flipstackk 6.0:**

- **Architecture Patterns**: Implement cleaner separation of concerns, domain-driven design principles vs. 3.0 structure[](https://www.halo-lab.com/blog/crm-system-design)​
    
- **RELAS Integration**: Design API layer to connect RELAS Python lead scoring engine or rebuild in TypeScript​
    
- **Real-Time Features**: Add WebSocket support for team collaboration, live lead updates not in 3.0[](https://artkai.io/blog/crm-development-guide)​
    
- **Advanced Automation**: Build workflow engine for automated follow-ups, lead routing, buyer notifications[](https://resimpli.com/blog/real-estate-wholesaling-software-tools/)​​
    
- **AI Integration Layer**: OpenAI integration for intelligent features (call script generation, offer suggestions, duplicate detection)[](https://resimpli.com/blog/investor-crm-showdown/)​​
    

**Justification:**

- **Speed to Market**: Leveraging proven Next.js/TypeScript stack reduces learning curve and accelerates development​
    
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reusing tested technologies (PostgreSQL, Prisma) avoids database selection paralysis and migration risks[](https://artkai.io/blog/crm-development-guide)​​
    
- **Team Continuity**: If original Flipstackk developers involved, familiar tech stack maximizes productivity
    
- **Strategic Flexibility**: Clean architecture on proven foundation supports future microservices extraction if scaling requires[](https://artkai.io/blog/crm-development-guide)​
    

**Critical Decision Points:**

- **Migration Path**: Can Flipstackk 3.0 production data (if any exists) migrate to 6.0 schema, or clean-slate start acceptable?
    
- **Repository Strategy**: Monorepo (single Next.js app) vs. polyrepo (separate frontend/backend/RELAS services)?​
    
- **Deployment Continuity**: Can Flipstackk 6.0 deploy alongside 3.0 initially for parallel testing, or hard cutover required?

- **3 Sales Reps**: Inbound handling, offer generation (assume 6 hrs/day × 3 = 18 concurrent hours daily)
    
- **1 Cold Caller**: Part-time calling (assume 4 hrs/day)
    
- **2 Co-Founders**: Strategic oversight, occasional heavy usage (assume 2 hrs/day × 2 = 4 hours)
    
- **Total**: ~50 person-hours/day, ~1,000-1,500 person-hours/month
    

**Data Volume Projections:**​

- **Lead Volume**: 500 properties/month scraped → 150-200 qualified leads​
    
- **Annual Leads**: ~6,000 leads/year, 24,000 leads over 4 years (consider data retention policies)
    
- **Buyer Database**: Start with 50-100 buyers, grow to 500-1,000 over 2 years
    
- **Deals**: 2-5 closed deals/month → 24-60 deals/year​
    
- **Communications**: Estimate 50-100 SMS/emails per lead × 500 leads = 25,000-50,000 messages/month
    
- **Documents**: ~500 offers/month generated, ~100 contracts/month signed
    

**Performance Requirements:**

**Response Time Targets:**

- **Page Load**: <2 seconds for dashboard, <1 second for lead list
    
- **Search**: <500ms for lead/buyer search with filters
    
- **API Endpoints**: <200ms for CRUD operations, <1s for complex calculations (MAO, comps)
    
- **Real-Time Updates**: <500ms latency for WebSocket events (lead status changes, team notifications)
    

**Concurrency:**

- **Peak Usage**: Assume 5-10 concurrent users during business hours (8am-6pm EST)
    
- **Database Connections**: PostgreSQL pool of 20-50 connections sufficient for foreseeable growth[](https://artkai.io/blog/crm-development-guide)​​
    
- **API Rate Limits**: Design for 100 requests/minute per user (conservative buffer)
    

**Scalability Checkpoints:**

- **Milestone 1**: 10 concurrent users, 10,000 leads, 1,000 buyers (Year 1)
    
- **Milestone 2**: 25 concurrent users, 50,000 leads, 5,000 buyers (Year 2-3 if SaaS launch)
    
- **Milestone 3**: 100+ concurrent users, 500,000+ leads, 50,000+ buyers (Long-term SaaS scale)
    

**High-Volume Considerations:**

- **Database Indexing**: Critical indexes on lead search fields (status, score, zip, date added), buyer buy-box criteria[](https://artkai.io/blog/crm-development-guide)​
    
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for frequently accessed data (active leads, user sessions, dashboard KPIs)[](https://artkai.io/blog/crm-development-guide)​
    
- **Background Jobs**: Queue system (Bull/BullMQ with Redis) for long-running tasks (lead enrichment, bulk SMS, report generation)​[](https://artkai.io/blog/crm-development-guide)​
    
- **CDN**: CloudFront or Vercel Edge for static assets (images, property photos, PDFs)
    
- **Monitoring**: Implement application performance monitoring (APM) from Day 1 (Sentry, DataDog, or New Relic)
    

## 14. Development Priorities: Speed, Cost, or Flexibility

**Recommended Priority: Speed First, Cost-Conscious, Flexibility for Scale**

**Speed Justification:**

- **Market Opportunity**: Real estate wholesaling is competitive - faster to market captures deals and validates product​
    
- **Internal Validation**: KevnBen Estate needs functional tool quickly to improve current operations and prove ROI before SaaS investment​
    
- **Competitive Dynamics**: Competitors (REsimpli, InvestorLift) constantly adding features - delayed launch risks obsolescence[](https://www.realestateskills.com/blog/dataflik-review)​
    
- **Team Momentum**: Extended development cycles risk team disengagement and scope creep
    

**Speed Optimization Strategies:**

- **Proven Tech Stack**: Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL - no experimental technologies reducing debugging time​
    
- **Component Libraries**: shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS provide pre-built UI components vs. custom design​
    
- **Incremental Delivery**: Ship MVP features sequentially, gather feedback, iterate vs. Big Bang launch
    
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Leverage BMad Method agents and AI coding tools (GitHub Copilot, Cursor) to accelerate implementation​
    
- **Defer Optimizations**: Accept technical debt in non-critical paths, refactor later based on real usage patterns
    

**Cost Consciousness:**

- **Infrastructure**: Vercel Hobby plan ($0) or Pro ($20/month) sufficient for MVP vs. AWS complexity​
    
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Vercel/Railway/Supabase (<$25/month) vs. RDS ($50-$200/month)
    
- **Third-Party Services**: Leverage free tiers where available (Twilio trial credits, PandaDoc sandbox)​
    
- **Development**: Consider AI-assisted solo developer vs. full team if budget constrained (trade time for cost)
    
- **Monitoring**: Start with free tiers (Sentry, LogRocket) vs. enterprise APM tools ($300+/month)
    

**Flexibility for Future Scale:**

- **Clean Architecture**: Implement domain-driven design separating business logic from infrastructure for future extraction[](https://www.halo-lab.com/blog/crm-system-design)​
    
- **API-First Design**: Build internal APIs assuming external clients in future (SaaS customers, mobile apps, integrations)[](https://artkai.io/blog/crm-development-guide)​
    
- **Database Schema Versioning**: Use Prisma migrations for schema evolution, avoid breaking changes​
    
- **Feature Flags**: Implement feature flag system (LaunchDarkly free tier or custom) for gradual rollouts and A/B testing
    
- **Multi-Tenancy Prep**: Design data isolation patterns (tenant_id in tables) even if single-tenant initially[](https://artkai.io/blog/crm-development-guide)​
    

**Trade-Off Decisions:**

- **Monolith vs. Microservices**: Start with Next.js monolith for speed, extract services only when scaling demands (avoid premature optimization)[](https://artkai.io/blog/crm-development-guide)​​
    
- **Custom vs. Third-Party**: Use SaaS tools (e.g., PostHog for analytics, Resend for transactional email) vs. building custom for faster delivery
    
- **Perfect vs. Good**: Ship 80% solution quickly, iterate to perfection based on user feedback vs. 6-month polishing before launch
    

## 15. Modular Architecture for Future Expansion

**Interface Design for Future Marketplace:**

- **Public API Layer**: Design `/api/v1/public/*` endpoints with OAuth 2.0 for external developers (future marketplace apps)
    
- **Webhook System**: Emit events (lead.created, deal.closed, buyer.matched) for external system subscriptions​
    
- **Data Export**: Build bulk export APIs (CSV, JSON) for data portability and marketplace integrations
    
- **White-Label UI**: Component architecture supporting theme customization for potential white-label offerings
    

**Mobile App Readiness:**[](https://resimpli.com/blog/real-estate-wholesaling-software-tools/)​​

- **API-First**: All functionality accessible via REST/tRPC APIs, not coupled to Next.js server components
    
- **Responsive Design**: Web UI mobile-optimized as stopgap, but architected for native app data syncing
    
- **Offline Support Prep**: Design data models considering eventual offline-first mobile architecture (local SQLite, sync conflicts)
    
- **Push Notifications**: Implement notification service (Firebase Cloud Messaging) usable by both web and mobile
    

**Scalability Patterns:**[](https://artkai.io/blog/crm-development-guide)​

- **Database Sharding**: Design schema with `tenant_id` for future sharding by customer
    
- **CQRS Preparation**: Separate read models (dashboards, reports) from write models (lead entry, deal updates) for future event sourcing
    
- **Microservices Gateway**: If extracting services, use API gateway pattern (Kong, Tyk) for unified routing and authentication
    
- **Event Bus**: Implement in-memory event bus (Node.js EventEmitter) that can evolve to distributed (Kafka, RabbitMQ) if microservices emerge

- **Offline Fallback**: Service worker caching for basic read-only access to recently viewed leads
    
- **Push Notifications**: Web push for hot lead alerts, deal status changes (requires user opt-in)
    

**Phase 2: Native Mobile Apps (If Validated Need):**​[](https://resimpli.com/blog/real-estate-wholesaling-software-tools/)​

**Use Cases Justifying Native Development:**

- **Offline-First**: Field agents need full CRUD on leads without connectivity (driving for dollars in rural areas)[](https://resimpli.com/blog/real-estate-wholesaling-software-tools/)​
    
- **Advanced Camera**: Multi-photo capture with annotations, property exterior/interior documentation
    
- **GPS Integration**: Location tracking for driving for dollars routes, property proximity alerts[](https://resimpli.com/blog/real-estate-wholesaling-software-tools/)​
    
- **Native Performance**: Large data sets (10,000+ leads) perform better in native vs. web
    
- **Push Reliability**: Native push notifications more reliable than web push for time-sensitive alerts
    

**Technology Options:**

- **React Native**: Reuse React/TypeScript skills from web app, Expo for rapid development
    
- **Flutter**: If team has Dart experience, excellent performance and UI consistency
    
- **Native (Swift/Kotlin)**: Maximum performance and platform integration, but highest development cost
    

**Decision Framework:**

- **Validate First**: Measure mobile web usage analytics - if <30% of team uses mobile web, defer native apps
    
- **Budget Check**: Native apps require $30,000-$60,000+ development for iOS+Android vs. $0 additional for responsive web
    
- **Maintenance Burden**: Native apps require ongoing updates for OS changes, app store approvals, separate QA cycles
    

**Current Recommendation: Responsive Web + PWA for MVP**[](https://www.halo-lab.com/blog/crm-system-design)​​

- **Rationale**: 80% of mobile use cases (viewing leads, updating status, making calls) work well in mobile browser​
    
- **Cost-Effective**: Single codebase for all devices, focus development on features vs. platform-specific code
    
- **Fast Iteration**: Update web app anytime without app store approval delays
    
- **Re-Evaluate**: If user feedback shows critical mobile-only needs (offline, GPS features), revisit native apps in Phase 2[](https://resimpli.com/blog/real-estate-wholesaling-software-tools/)​
    

## 18. Themes, Accessibility, Internationalization (i18n)

**Themes:**

**MVP Approach: Single Professional Theme**[](https://www.halo-lab.com/blog/crm-system-design)​​

- **Design System**: Define color palette, typography, spacing using Tailwind CSS design tokens​
    
- **Brand Consistency**: Align with KevnBen Estate brand if exists, or create clean, professional real estate aesthetic
    
- **shadcn/ui Components**: Leverage pre-built, themeable components (buttons, forms, dialogs) for consistency​
    

**Future Theme Support (If SaaS Launch):**

- **Light/Dark Mode**: Implement theme toggle using Tailwind dark mode classes, user preference persistence
    
- **Custom Branding**: Allow enterprise customers to customize logo, primary colors (CSS variables approach)
    
- **White-Label**: Full theme customization for resellers (requires theme builder UI, increased complexity)
    

**Accessibility (a11y):**[](https://www.halo-lab.com/blog/crm-system-design)​

**WCAG AA Compliance Target:**[](https://www.halo-lab.com/blog/crm-system-design)​​

- **Semantic HTML**: Use proper heading hierarchy (`<h1>`-`<h6>`), landmark elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`)
    
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements accessible via Tab, Enter, Escape keys (no mouse-only interactions)[](https://www.halo-lab.com/blog/crm-system-design)​
    
- **Focus Indicators**: Visible focus outlines on all interactive elements (Tailwind `focus:` utilities)[](https://www.halo-lab.com/blog/crm-system-design)​
    
- **Color Contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 ratio for text, 3:1 for UI components (use Tailwind's accessible color scales)[](https://www.halo-lab.com/blog/crm-system-design)​
    
- **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA labels for icon buttons, live regions for status updates, descriptive link text[](https://www.halo-lab.com/blog/crm-system-design)​
    
- **Form Accessibility**: Associated labels, error messages, required field indicators, validation feedback[](https://www.halo-lab.com/blog/crm-system-design)​
    

**Priority Accessibility Features:**

- **Skip Links**: "Skip to main content" for keyboard users to bypass navigation[](https://www.halo-lab.com/blog/crm-system-design)​
    
- **Alt Text**: Descriptive alt attributes for property photos, icons
    
- **Tooltips**: Context for icon-only buttons using accessible tooltip components
    
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages associated with form fields, not just color coding
    

**Testing:**

- **Automated**: Axe DevTools or pa11y in CI/CD pipeline to catch common violations[](https://www.halo-lab.com/blog/crm-system-design)​
    
- **Manual**: Keyboard-only navigation testing, screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
    

**Internationalization (i18n):**

**MVP Approach: English-Only, i18n-Ready Architecture**

**Current Justification:**​

- **Market Focus**: KevnBen Estate operates in Florida, Massachusetts, Rhode Island (English-speaking markets)​
    
- **User Base**: Team and customers are English speakers
    
- **Development Speed**: Avoid i18n complexity in MVP to ship faster
    

**i18n-Ready Patterns:**

- **String Externalization**: Use `next-intl` or `react-i18next` library from Day 1, even if only English locale
    
- **Date/Time Formatting**: Use `Intl.DateTimeFormat` for locale-aware dates (defaults to US formats for MVP)
    
- **Currency**: Use `Intl.NumberFormat` for currency display (USD for MVP, easy to extend)
    
- **No Hardcoded Strings**: All UI text in translation files (JSON), not inline in components
    

**Future i18n Expansion (If Needed):**

- **Spanish**: If expanding to Hispanic wholesalers or Florida's Spanish-speaking markets
    
- **Regional Dialects**: Canadian English, British English if expanding internationally
    
- **Right-to-Left (RTL)**: Hebrew, Arabic if Middle East markets relevant (requires CSS adjustments)
    

**Decision Point:** Defer full i18n implementation until validated demand. Use i18n-ready architecture but don't translate until 10% of target users request non-English support.

## 19. API Requirements & Existing Integrations

**Internal APIs (Flipstackk 6.0 Backend):**

**API Architecture Pattern: tRPC for Type-Safe RPC**​

- **Rationale**: tRPC provides end-to-end type safety between Next.js frontend and backend without OpenAPI schema maintenance​
    
- **Alternative**: RESTful API with OpenAPI/Swagger if exposing public API to external developers
    

**Core API Modules:**[](https://artkai.io/blog/crm-development-guide)​​

**Authentication API:**

**External API Integrations:**

**RELAS API (Lead Scoring):**​

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/enrich` - Submit property data for enrichment
    
- **Request**: `{ address, city, state, zip, ownerName, ownerMailingAddress, lastSaleDate, assessedValue, propertyUse }`
    
- **Response**: `{ isAbsentee, yearsOwned, motivationScore, scoringFactors[] }`
    
- **Authentication**: API key in header
    
- **Rate Limits**: 100 requests/minute (batch requests for bulk enrichment)
    
- **Error Handling**: Retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
    
- **Deployment**: RELAS deployed as Docker container alongside Flipstackk, or separate Python service with health checks​
    

**Twilio API (SMS & Voice):**​

- **SDK**: `twilio` npm package
    
- **Capabilities**:
    
    - Send SMS: `client.messages.create({ body, to, from: twilioNumber })`
        
    - Initiate call: `client.calls.create({ url: callbackUrl, to, from })`
        
    - Webhooks: Receive incoming SMS/calls, delivery status updates

- **Pricing**: SMS $0.0079/message, Voice $0.0085-0.014/min​
    
- **Compliance**: Store message consent, opt-out handling (STOP keyword)
    

**PandaDoc API (E-Signatures):**​

- **SDK**: `@pandadoc/node-sdk`
    
- **OAuth 2.0**: User grants Flipstackk permission to send documents on their behalf
    
- **Workflow**:
    
    1. Create document from template with Flipstackk offer data
        
    2. Add recipients (seller, buyer) with signer roles
        
    3. Send for signature via `POST /documents/{id}/send`
        
    4. Webhooks: `document.viewed`, `document.completed` events update deal status in Flipstackk
        
- **Document Retrieval**: `GET /documents/{id}/download` to store signed PDF in Flipstackk storage
    
- **Pricing**: Check PandaDoc tier limits (document sends/month)​
    

**Property Data APIs (Comps & Enrichment):**​

- **Options**:
    
    - **Attom Data API**: Property details, sales history, valuations (enterprise pricing)
        
    - **RentCast API**: Rental comps, estimated values (check pricing tiers)​
        
    - **PropStream API**: If integrating vs. competing[](https://resimpli.com/blog/propstream-alternatives-real-estate/)​
        
- **Rate Limits**: Cache frequently accessed data (property details for active leads) to reduce API costs
    
- **Fallback**: Manual comp entry UI if API unavailable or expensive
    

**API Documentation:**

- **Internal**: tRPC infers types automatically, but maintain markdown docs for workflow examples​
    
- **External**: If exposing public API, generate OpenAPI schema and host Swagger UI docs
    

## 20. First Sprint Length & Launch Milestone

Testing Phase Responses

## 21. Critical User Journeys to Test

**Priority 1: Lead-to-Deal Core Workflow**

**Journey 1: Lead Intake to Qualified Lead**​

1. **Scenario**: Acquisitions manager receives seller call, enters lead into Flipstackk
    
2. **Steps**:
    
    - Log in with acquisitions role credentials
        
    - Click "Add Lead" button
        
    - Fill out lead form (property address with autocomplete, owner name, phone, motivation notes)
        
    - Submit form
        
    - RELAS enrichment triggers automatically (background job)​
        
    - Lead appears in list with "Pending Enrichment" status
        
    - After enrichment (1-2 min), lead shows motivation score (e.g., 78 - Hot Lead)​
        
    - Manager reviews enriched data (absentee owner: Yes, years owned: 12.3)​
        
    - Updates status to "Contacted" → "Qualified"
        
3. **Expected Outcomes**:
    
    - Lead created successfully with all data saved
        
    - RELAS enrichment completes without errors, score calculated​
        
    - Lead visible in appropriate filtered views (Hot Leads dashboard widget)
        
    - Status pipeline updates reflected in lead list and detail view
        
    - Activity log records status changes with timestamps and user
        
4. **Edge Cases**:
    
    - Duplicate lead detection (same address warns user)​
        
    - Invalid address handling (geocoding failure, manual override)
        
    - RELAS API timeout (retry logic, fallback to manual scoring)
        
    - Concurrent edits (last-write-wins or conflict detection)
        

**Journey 2: Qualified Lead to Offer Sent**​

1. **Scenario**: Acquisitions manager qualifies lead, generates and sends offer
    
2. **Steps**:
    
    - Open qualified lead detail page
        
    - Click "Create Offer" button
        
    - Select offer template (e.g., "Cash Offer - As-Is")
        
    - Review MAO calculator (ARV: $200k, Repairs: $30k, Fee: $10k → MAO: $100k)​
        
    - Adjust offer price based on motivation score (offer $95k for hot lead)
        
    - Generate offer PDF with pre-filled property and owner details
        
    - Review offer in PandaDoc integration modal
        
    - Add seller email, send for e-signature​

    - Offer PDF generated with accurate details (no placeholder text)
        
    - PandaDoc API call succeeds, document ID stored in deal record​
        
    - Seller receives email with offer link (PandaDoc confirms delivery)​
        
    - Deal status updates, offer visible in "Pending Signature" view
        
    - Notification sent to team (Slack/email): "Offer sent to [address]"
        
4. **Edge Cases**:
    
    - Missing property data (ARV unknown - manual entry required)
        
    - PandaDoc API failure (retry logic, error message to user)​
        
    - Seller doesn't receive email (resend functionality, phone backup)
        
    - Offer declined (webhook updates status to "Offer Rejected")
        

**Journey 3: Signed Contract to Buyer Match to Assignment**​

1. **Scenario**: Seller signs offer, disposition finds buyer, assigns contract
    
2. **Steps**:
    
    - PandaDoc webhook triggers on `document.completed` event​
        
    - Flipstackk updates deal status to "Under Contract"
        
    - Notification to disposition team: "New signed contract - [address]"
        
    - Dispo user opens deal, clicks "Find Buyers"
        
    - System matches property to buyer buy boxes (3 matches found)​
        
    - Dispo selects buyer, generates assignment contract
        
    - Sends assignment contract via PandaDoc to buyer​
        
    - Buyer signs, deal status updates to "Assigned"
        
    - Closing coordinator receives notification to schedule closing
        
3. **Expected Outcomes**:
    
    - Webhook correctly updates deal status without user action
        
    - Buyer matching algorithm returns relevant buyers (location, price range, property type match)​
        
    - Assignment contract pre-filled with seller contract terms
        
    - Buyer receives assignment contract, signs successfully​
        
    - Deal appears in "Closing Pipeline" dashboard
        
    - Assignment fee calculated and displayed ($10k in this example)
        
4. **Edge Cases**:
    
    - No buyer matches found (manual buyer outreach workflow)
        
    - Buyer selected but proof of funds missing (POF upload prompt)​
        
    - Assignment contract terms conflict with original contract (validation warnings)
        
    - Buyer doesn't sign (reminder emails, deal falls through workflow)
        

**Priority 2: Team Collaboration & Communication**​

**Journey 4: Lead Assignment and Follow-Up**​

1. **Scenario**: VA cold calls lead, assigns to sales rep for follow-up
    
2. **Steps**:
    
    - VA logs call outcome (answered, motivated, requested more info)
        
    - Assigns lead to sales rep "Kevin" for follow-up
        
    - Kevin receives notification (in-app + email)
        
    - Kevin opens lead, reviews call notes
        
    - Sends SMS via Flipstackk-Twilio integration: "Hi [name], I can make you an offer today..."​
        
    - Seller responds via SMS (Twilio webhook captures response)​
        
    - Kevin schedules property visit, adds calendar event to deal
        
3. **Expected Outcomes**:
    
    - Lead assignment triggers notification to correct user
        
    - Call notes visible in lead activity timeline
        
    - SMS sends successfully, thread visible in Communications tab​
        
    - Inbound SMS appears in real-time (WebSocket or polling)​
        
    - Calendar event syncs to Google Calendar (if integration enabled)
        
4. **Edge Cases**:
    
    - Assigned user not available (reassignment to backup)
        
    - SMS delivery failure (Twilio error, fallback to phone call prompt)​
        
    - Inbound SMS from unknown number (lead matching by phone)
        

**Journey 5: Dashboard KPI Review by Owner**​

1. **Scenario**: Benji reviews weekly performance metrics
    
2. **Steps**:
    
    - Log in with admin role
        
    - Navigate to Analytics dashboard
        
    - View KPI widgets: leads added (120 this week), hot leads (35), offers sent (18), contracts signed (4), deals closed (2)​
        
    - Drill into conversion funnel: New (500) → Contacted (320) → Qualified (150) → Offer Sent (60) → Under Contract (12) → Assigned (8) → Closed (5)
        
    - Filter by team member performance (Kevin closed 3 deals, Mike closed 2)
        
    - Export weekly report to PDF for investor update
        
3. **Expected Outcomes**:
    
    - All KPIs display accurate data (cross-check with database queries)​
        
    - Conversion funnel percentages calculated correctly
        
    - Date range filters work (this week, last month, custom range)
        
    - Team performance metrics reflect individual contributions
        
    - PDF export generates formatted report with charts
        
4. **Edge Cases**:

    - Data discrepancies (audit trail for status changes)
        

**Priority 3: Error Recovery & Edge Cases**

**Journey 6: System Failure Recovery**

1. **Scenario**: Database connection lost, API timeout, user handles gracefully
    
2. **Steps**:
    
    - User editing lead details when database becomes unavailable
        
    - Save button clicked
        
    - Error displayed: "Unable to save. Connection issue. Changes saved locally."
        
    - Network reconnects
        
    - System auto-retries save, success message appears
        
3. **Expected Outcomes**:
    
    - No data loss (client-side caching or optimistic UI)
        
    - Clear error messages without technical jargon
        
    - Automatic retry without user intervention
        
    - Transaction rollback if partial save occurs
        
4. **Testing**: Simulate network failures, database connection pool exhaustion, third-party API outages[](https://artkai.io/blog/crm-development-guide)​
    

## 22. Load Testing vs. Feature Validation

**MVP Approach: Prioritize Feature Validation, Basic Load Testing**

**Feature Validation (Primary Focus):**

**Manual Testing (Exploratory):**

- **Stakeholder Testing**: Co-founders, VAs, sales reps test features during Sprint Reviews​
    
- **Dogfooding**: Use Flipstackk 6.0 for real deals during pilot phase (parallel with old system)
    
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Formal sign-off on each epic before marking complete
    
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (desktop + mobile)
    
- **Device Testing**: iPhone, Android phones, iPad, desktop (responsive design validation)[](https://www.halo-lab.com/blog/crm-system-design)​
    

**Automated Testing:**​

- **Unit Tests**: Vitest for business logic (MAO calculation, lead scoring, buyer matching algorithms)​
    
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints with real database (Prisma + test containers)
    
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for critical user journeys (login → add lead → generate offer → send for signature)​
    
- **Visual Regression**: Percy or Chromatic for UI consistency across changes
    
- **Coverage Target**: 80%+ code coverage for core domains (leads, deals, buyers)​
    

**Load Testing (Secondary - Basic Validation):**

**Rationale:**

- **Small Team**: 10-15 concurrent users max initially (not high-scale scenario)​
    
- **Gradual Growth**: Can add load testing infrastructure if/when scaling to SaaS
    
- **Cost-Benefit**: Load testing tooling (k6, Gatling, LoadRunner) and expertise expensive for MVP
    

**Minimal Load Testing:**

- **Baseline Performance**: Measure response times for common operations under normal load (1-5 concurrent users)
    
- **Spike Testing**: Simulate 20-30 concurrent users hitting lead list endpoint (2-3x expected peak) to identify bottlenecks[](https://artkai.io/blog/crm-development-guide)​
    
- **Database Query Performance**: Use PostgreSQL's `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to optimize slow queries (>100ms)[](https://artkai.io/blog/crm-development-guide)​
    
- **API Endpoint Benchmarking**: Apache Bench or wrk to test critical endpoints (100 req/sec target)[](https://artkai.io/blog/crm-development-guide)​
    

**Defer to Phase 2+:**

- **Stress Testing**: Breaking point testing (hundreds of concurrent users)
    
- **Endurance Testing**: 24-hour soak tests for memory leaks, connection pool exhaustion
    
- **Scalability Testing**: Validating horizontal scaling (multiple app instances, load balancer)
    

**Decision Point:** If transitioning to multi-tenant SaaS with 100+ customers, invest in comprehensive load testing infrastructure. For internal tool serving <20 users, feature validation ROI is higher.

## 23. QA Tools

**Recommended QA Toolchain:**

**Automated Testing:**​

**Unit & Integration Testing:**

- **Vitest**: Fast, modern test runner for TypeScript/JavaScript (Vite-based)​
    
- **Testing Library**: React Testing Library for component testing (user-centric assertions)
    
- **Prisma Test Environment**: Isolated test databases using Docker or in-memory SQLite
    
- **Example**:

- **Code Review**: At least one approval before merge to main branch
    
- **Coverage Threshold**: 80% unit test coverage maintained​
    

## 24. Sensitive System Components

**Highest Sensitivity Areas (Priority Security & Testing):**

**Personal Identifiable Information (PII):**​

**Lead Owner Data:**​

- **Sensitivity**: Owner names, phone numbers, email addresses, mailing addresses
    
- **Regulatory**: CCPA (California), GDPR (if any EU customers), state privacy laws​
    
- **Security Measures**:
    
    - Encrypt PII at rest (PostgreSQL column encryption or AWS RDS encryption)
        
    - Encrypt in transit (HTTPS/TLS for all API calls)
        
    - Access control (RBAC - only acquisitions and admin roles can view owner details)​
        
    - Audit logging (track who accessed which lead data, when)​
        
    - Data retention policy (delete leads after X months if deal not closed)​
        
    - Opt-out mechanism (seller requests data deletion, CCPA compliance)​
        

**Buyer Information:**​

- **Sensitivity**: Buyer contact info, proof of funds documents (bank statements, credit reports)
    
- **Security Measures**:
    
    - POF documents stored in encrypted S3 bucket with signed URLs (time-limited access)​
        
    - Redact sensitive buyer data in logs (no PII in Sentry error reports)
        
    - Buyer data access limited to dispo team and admin roles​
        

**Financial & Deal Information:**

**Deal Terms & Assignment Fees:**​

- **Sensitivity**: Contract terms, purchase prices, assignment fees (competitive intelligence if leaked)
    
- **Security Measures**:
    
    - Role-based access (VAs cannot view assignment fees, only acquisition managers and up)​
        
    - Audit trail for deal changes (who modified offer price, when)
        
    - Backup/disaster recovery (daily database backups to secure off-site storage)[](https://artkai.io/blog/crm-development-guide)​
        

**Contract Documents:**​

- **Sensitivity**: Signed contracts contain seller signatures, legal terms
    
- **Security Measures**:
    
    - Store in secured S3 bucket (not public-readable)
        
    - Access via signed URLs with expiration (1 hour validity)
        
    - Integration with PandaDoc for secure document workflow (PandaDoc handles encryption)​
        
    - Immutable audit trail (contract versions, signature timestamps)
        

**Authentication & Authorization:**​

**User Credentials:**​

- **Sensitivity**: Passwords must never be stored in plaintext
    
- **Security Measures**:
    
    - bcrypt password hashing (work factor 12+)​
        
    - Secure session management (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies)​
        
    - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin roles (Phase 2)
        
    - Rate limiting on login endpoint (prevent brute force - 5 attempts/min max)
        

**API Keys & Secrets:**​

- **Sensitivity**: RELAS API key, Twilio auth token, PandaDoc API key, database connection string​
    
- **Security Measures**:
    
    - Environment variables (never commit to Git)​
        
    - Secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, Vercel Environment Variables)
        
    - Rotate secrets quarterly or on team member departure
        
    - Least privilege (API keys with minimal required permissions)
        

**Business Logic Integrity:**

**Lead Scoring Algorithm (RELAS):**​

- **Sensitivity**: Scoring accuracy directly impacts deal prioritization and revenue
    
- **Testing**:
    
    - Unit tests for each scoring factor (absentee: +30 points, 10+ years owned: +25 points)​
        
    - Integration tests with known leads (assert score 85 for known hot lead)​
        
    - Regression tests (ensure scoring doesn't drift with code changes)
        
    - Manual validation (acquisitions managers compare scores to their judgment)
        

**MAO Calculator:**​

- **Sensitivity**: Incorrect MAO calculation leads to unprofitable offers or lost deals
    
- **Testing**:
    
    - Unit tests with various property scenarios (high ARV/low repairs, low ARV/high repairs)
        
    - Edge cases (negative MAO, zero repairs, missing ARV - should error gracefully)
        
    - User acceptance testing (acquisitions managers verify calculations match manual comps)
        

**Buyer Matching:**​

- **Sensitivity**: Poor matches waste time, good matches close deals faster
    
- **Testing**:
    
    - Test buy box criteria filtering (price range, location radius, property type)
        
    - Edge cases (buyer wants "3-4 bed" matched to 3-bed property, not 2-bed)
        
    - Performance testing (query 10,000 buyers for matches in <500ms)[](https://artkai.io/blog/crm-development-guide)​
        

**Data Integrity:**

**Database Transactions:**[](https://artkai.io/blog/crm-development-guide)​

- **Sensitivity**: Concurrent updates (two users editing same lead) must not corrupt data
    
- **Testing**:
    
    - Concurrency tests (simulate simultaneous updates, verify last-write-wins or conflict detection)
        
    - Transaction rollback testing (ensure partial saves don't leave inconsistent state)[](https://artkai.io/blog/crm-development-guide)​
        

**External Integration Reliability:**​

**RELAS API:**​

- **Failure Modes**: Timeout, 500 error, invalid response format
    
- **Testing**:
    
    - Mock RELAS failures in tests, verify graceful degradation (lead saved, enrichment retried later)
        
    - Circuit breaker pattern (stop calling RELAS if failure rate >50% for 1 min, retry after cooldown)​
        

**PandaDoc API:**​

- **Failure Modes**: OAuth token expired, API rate limit exceeded, webhook delivery failure
    
- **Testing**:
    
    - Mock PandaDoc errors, verify user sees meaningful error message
        
    - Webhook idempotency (handle duplicate `document.completed` events)
        
    - Retry logic (exponential backoff for failed API calls)​
        

**Twilio API:**​

- **Failure Modes**: SMS delivery failure, phone number invalid, rate limit exceeded
    
- **Testing**:
    
    - Mock Twilio errors, verify SMS marked as "failed" with retry option
        
    - Handle invalid phone numbers (validation before sending)
        
    - Monitor usage to avoid exceeding Twilio account limits​
        

## 25. Confirmation & Validation Strategy

**Pre-Deployment Validation:**

**Staging Environment Testing:**[](https://artkai.io/blog/crm-development-guide)​

- **Environment**: Staging environment mirroring production (same tech stack, scaled-down resources)
    
- **Data**: Seed staging database with anonymized production-like data (100 leads, 50 buyers, 20 deals)
    
- **Process**:
    
    - Deploy to staging after all Sprint tests pass
        
    - Smoke test critical user journeys (login, add lead, generate offer)
        
    - Stakeholder UAT (co-founders, VA team lead test for 2-3 days)​
        
    - Bug fixes deployed to staging, retested before production
        

**Production Deployment Checklist:**​
